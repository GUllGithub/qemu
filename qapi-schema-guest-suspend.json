# @guest-suspend-disk
#
# Suspend guest to disk.
#
# This command tries to execute the scripts provided by the pm-utils package.
# If it's not available, the suspend operation will be performed by manually
# writing to a sysfs file.
#
# For the best results it's strongly recommended to have the pm-utils
# package installed in the guest.
#
# Returns: nothing on success
#          If suspend to disk is not supported, Unsupported
#
# Notes: o This is an asynchronous request. There's no guarantee a response
#          will be sent
#        o It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command before
#          sending commands when the guest resumes
#
# Since: 1.1

# @guest-suspend-ram
#
# Suspend guest to ram.

# This command tries to execute the scripts provided by the pm-utils package.
# If it's not available, the suspend operation will be performed by manually
# writing to a sysfs file.

#
# IMPORTANT: guest-suspend-ram requires QEMU to support the 'system_wakeup'
# command.  Thus, it's *required* to query QEMU for the presence of the
# 'system_wakeup' command before issuing guest-suspend-ram.
#
# Returns: nothing on success

# @guest-suspend-hybrid
#
# Save guest state to disk and suspend to ram.
